        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a proud Australian Aboriginal woman. I have a Diploma of Project Management and have studied linguistics and philosophy. I have worked primarily in the digital space beginning with website and intranet management. I have moved onto working with businesses in projects and change management roles to identify and bring to life digital opportunities. I usually act as the intermediary between IT and the business.</p>
        <h2>Interesting fact</h2>
        <p>I enjoy weightlifting and I can bench press my desired body weight of 65 kilograms!</p>
        <h1>Interest in Information Technology</h1>
        <p>My interest in IT started early watching the Jetsons on TV! My interest now is making services, especially government, easier, cheaper and better for ordinary people.  I believe technology benefits should be available to everyone. I have met many people who are entitled to and could use government services for a better life, but they do not and cannot learn of and access them because they lack both traditional and digital literacy and access. To that end I have a special interest in human centred design and the Digital Service Standard.  I have filled roles of web master, information architect, business analyst, product owner, project manager, change manager, and digital lead in government organisations.  I am acutely aware we need to involve clients early and deeply, and IT roles change by the day so you must constantly upgrade your skills and knowledge.  I use Udemy.com to stay on top.  Although I do not fill any specialist hard core roles, it is important to understand what they do to explain matters to clients and set realistic expectations and demands.</p>
        <h2>Why I chose RMIT</h2>
        <p>I chose RMIT as it has a strong reputation as a university for Information Technology studies. I study through Open Universities Australia for flexibility.</p>    
        <p>I expect my studies to lead to a better understanding of different specialist roles and services to communicate and use them better to build valuable and robust services</p>
