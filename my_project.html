        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>My idea is to create an app for my local butcher to promote gourmet sausages and meat items. It needs to be simple enough for the butcher, a non-technical user, to easily update each day with photos and captions. Customers should be able to subscribe to receive daily updates or just the weekend specials via email or sms.  Customers should be able to vote for the next day’s sausage as well as being able to preorder and pay through the app and nominate a day/time for pickup.  The butcher needs to be able to access this orders list to ensure items are prepared. This would allow the butcher to increase sales and his range of specialist meat products with a reliable customer response.</p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The butcher once made a daily range of specialty gourmet sausages but as most of the locals back then had “peanut butter and white bread” taste they stopped offering them, particularly during the week, as sales were unreliable. Customers who did enjoy product could not predict when specialties might be available so tended to go elsewhere – a disadvantage for both parties.  The butcher has been winning back a more tasty following for gourmet and novelty sausages (eg vegemite and cheese) in small batches on weekends.  Unfortunately both the butcher and customers are still plagued by variable supply and demand. The butcher needs to guess which sausages will be popular and the customers need to guess when they might be available.  If we encourage consumers to indulge more regularly and reliably in gourmet sausages, the butcher will have enough reliable sales and encouragement to go further and release sausages through the week. Some simple customer research surveys and discussion groups at the local golf club and kids weekend football have already confirmed audience enthusiasm for being able to know what sausages are available and to buy them online to pick up.</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The project will be built as a responsive design website to overcome the need to develop and update apps for multiple operating systems. The customers interface for the site will immediately show today’s sausages for users to scroll through and choose from. Users will be able to subscribe to email or sms notifications to link them to the site each day for new gourmet fare. As well as seeing the sausages, customers should then be able to preorder items using PayPal and nominate a time for pickup. Customers should also see a short list of choices to vote for tomorrow’s sausage of the day.  A logged in butcher interface also needs to be available.  The butcher needs to be able to add items to the front screen for the customer, and obtain a list of prepaid orders to prepare. The butcher should also be able to take an item off when it runs out. The butcher needs to be able to monitor the voting for tomorrow’s sausage of the day so that it can be prepared and voting numbers will give an initial impression of orders to expect.  The initial minimum viable product would be a simple responsive web page and email subscription notification . Further stages will be</p>
        <ul>
        <li>SMS notifications</li>
        <li>an option to vote for a favourite sausage to be made the next day</li>
        <li>ann option to preorder online and nominate a time for pickup</li>
        <li>an option to pay online</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the butcher pilot site succeeds there would be an option to add other products, and potentially for other specialty food shops. It could be marketed to the shops as a group, or the Shopping Centre management, to express interest in expanding the app or creating copies to cover them.  Two interfaces will be required, one for the customers and one for the butcher.  It would be critical to build a simple training and update interface so that the butcher can easily update the site/app with photos and information from a tablet/phone each day.  We need to ensure appropriate information management and security for customers’ emails/mobile details and compliance with privacy concerns.  Paypal and Bpay should be used to minimise complications and ensure a safe payment platform. We need a non-digital promotion for customers to download the app/subscribe to the site – as simple as signs at the butcher shop and possibly a flyer at the weekend kids football, or a letterbox drop.</p>
        <h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>
        <p>I propose that we build a responsive website through a simple pre-programmed service like GoDaddy website builder.  This is for speed and to provide a well supported platform that the customer can go in and easily make simple updates themselves. We will need to obtain a website name, register the url, and set up a hosting contract. We will need to provide a secure database and email / SMS service to broadcast new sausages to customers.  We will need to provide a training and support service for the shopkeeper users (at this stage the butcher) so they can manage the app.  We will also need to monitor traffic through Analytics, and do some non-digital promotional activity both at the shop and with local sports facilities.</p>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        <p>Development will require html and css skills to build the website, although this could be minimised by the use of the GoDaddy web builder.  The developer will need a basic understanding of Mailchimp and Paypal to integrate them for notifications and payments. We will need front end developer UX skills to ensure the site is accessible to W3C AA level and meets both client and end customer needs for ease of use.  Human centred design skills will be needed to work with the team to ensure the customer needs are always paramount and the project does not go down an easiest for the team route.</p>    
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>The outcome will be a simple but effective marketing tool for the butcher business to increase business and a handy relatively unobtrusive service for customers to know about available product.  Eventually it could also include a simple pre-order and pay functionality to increase business certainty and customer satisfaction.</p>
